# TapJump
A  tapping mobile game made to study among other things, building for the Android plataform, save file management, sound control and working with touch input.

It was a very fun project to work, in the beginning it was going to be a mix of Gravity Guy with Geometry Dash, but then I realized that the physic aspect of these games was not what I was looking for. I also didn't wan to make anothe flappy bird clone. After a bit o thinking as experimentation I decided to make a game where you have to avoid obstacles by going up or down on the screen.

The apk file is available for testing on the Builds folder as  tp13.apk
